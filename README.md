This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in Python: TypeErrors caused by unexpected argument types.  The `bug.py` file shows a function that expects a numeric type but receives a string, causing a TypeError.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to use type hinting and input validation to prevent this error.
